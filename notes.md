# Altar event
* Good God or Evil God
* what is the boon for praying or destroying
* determine what your alignment is
* random chance to get a result, either good or bad

# character ideas
* warrior
    - more health and damage
    - starting character
* thief
    - can skip minion fights to go straight to the boss
    - powerful first attack
* ranger
    - throws sword
    - matches colors of dice
* sorcerress
    - yatzee style dice
* paladin
    - gains a new die at start of combat
        
# other ideas
* art direction should be like conan the barbarian, 70's style pulp fantasy
* boss fights should be like 70's sword and sorcery movie posters
* good ending - ascend into heaven, mountain tileset, conquer your demons (selfishness, lust, greed, etc)
* evil ending - descend into hell, volcanic tileset, slay your conscience (compassion, morality, 'humanity', duty, virtue) 

# what is in a random event?
* treasure    (consumables or gold)
* debuff      (consistent effect that hurts or decreases your power)
* powerup     (consistent effect that improves power like a inscription)
* health      (instantaneous health or durablility boost)
* lore        (just some text)
* unlockables (new characters, adventureres, swords)
