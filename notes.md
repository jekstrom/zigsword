# other ideas
* art direction should be like conan the barbarian, 70's style pulp fantasy
* boss fights should be like 70's sword and sorcery movie posters
* good ending - ascend into heaven, mountain tileset, conquer your demons (selfishness, lust, greed, etc)
* evil ending - descend into hell, volcanic tileset, slay your conscience (compassion, morality, 'humanity', duty, virtue) 
* base dice + mult dice, like balatro
* charging dice - there's a separate area to roll dice repeatedly, each time you roll it it gets more powerful
* loaded dice
* duplicate dice - get a number of dice of the same size equal to the result of the roll. E.g. a 4 on a d6 would roll 4 d6.
* called dice - you can predict the number of the die and if you are correct it gains a bonus
* bone dice - chance to break when you use
* rune word that increases in power when bone dice break
* health die - heals you or the adventurer when you use


# what is in a random event?
* treasure    (consumables or gold)
* debuff      (consistent effect that hurts or decreases your power)
* powerup     (consistent effect that improves power like a inscription)
* health      (instantaneous health or durablility boost)
* lore        (just some text)
* unlockables (new characters, adventureres, swords)
