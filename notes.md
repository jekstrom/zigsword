# game end
two endings - good and evil
kill 3 bosses and collect lode stones? tuning forks? runes? something that affects chance
Perthro (ᛈ) - Mystery / Fate / Lot Cup
Othala (ᛟ) - Inheritance / Ancestral Land / Legacy:
Dagaz (ᛞ) - Day / Dawn / Breakthrough
the final boss(es) should have unique abilities, game changing effects
    disable random rune
    splitting mechanism like oozes
    alternating phases of damage/immunity
    enrage
    turn all dice consumable
    corrosion attacks do more damage to sword
    increase in power each time they see the same adventurer

other runes:
ᚠ ᚡ ᚢ ᚣ ᚤ ᚥ ᚦ ᚧ ᚨ ᚩ ᚪ ᚫ ᚬ ᚭ ᚮ ᚯ ᛠ ᛡ ᛢ ᛣ ᛤ ᛥ ᛦ ᛧ ᛨ ᛩ ᛪ ᛮ ᛯ 

# Runes
Runes are inscribed onto the blade. Perhaps they are lost memories that you recover as you play the game.
Once you have restored enough memories, you can ascend and regain your human form. This ends the game and starts over.

# other ideas
* art direction should be like conan the barbarian, 70's style pulp fantasy
* boss fights should be like 70's sword and sorcery movie posters
* good ending - ascend into heaven, mountain tileset, conquer your demons (selfishness, lust, greed, etc)
* evil ending - descend into hell, volcanic tileset, slay your conscience (compassion, morality, 'humanity', duty, virtue) 
* base dice + mult dice, like balatro
* charging dice - there's a separate area to roll dice repeatedly, each time you roll it it gets more powerful
* loaded dice
* duplicate dice - get a number of dice of the same size equal to the result of the roll. E.g. a 4 on a d6 would roll 4 d6.
* called dice - you can predict the number of the die and if you are correct it gains a bonus
    * minigame to "predict" the number that will roll, like a bouncing arrow on a bar quicktime event thing
* bone dice - chance to break when you use
* rune word that increases in power when bone dice break
* health die - heals you or the adventurer when you use
* what damages the adventurer and what damages you (the sword)
  * monsters damage the adventurer
  * the adventurer damages the sword (by defending/attacking)
  * Environment can damage the sword
* Should the player know what the Monster's and Adventurer's next move is going to be?
  * Like Slay the Spire
  * Gives the player more decisions to make
* Endless mode?
    * instead of ascending once you have enough runes, you can skip it and keep going. Every 3 levels you get another opportunity to attempt ascending, but it gets harder each time.
* sword breakers
  * Special enemies/weapons that specifically target the player's durability

# what is in a random event?
* treasure  (consumables or gold)
* debuff   (consistent effect that hurts or decreases your power)
* powerup   (consistent effect that improves power like a inscription)
* health   (instantaneous health or durablility boost)
* lore    (just some text)
* unlockables (new characters, adventureres, swords)
